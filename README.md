# Cpts223-BST-implementation
Implement  the  BinarySearchTree  template  class  described  in  the  Weiss  book  (Figures  4.16-4.28, 
excluding 4.19) and add code for printing tree traversals and the DepthEqual method from HW5. 
Specifically: 
a. Accompanying this homework is the ZIP file hw6.zip, which contains the following files. 

i. BinarySearchTree.h:  A  version  of  the  BinarySearchTree  template  class  code  from 
Weiss’s book. The four private methods at the bottom (PreOrder, PostOrder, InOrder, 
DepthEqual) are what you need to implement. 

ii. main.cc: The main function we will run to test your code. 

iii. Makefile: A sample Makefile for compiling the code. 

iv. input.txt: A sample input file to test your code. 

v. output.txt: The correct output you should see when you run ‘main input.txt’.
